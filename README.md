# JB2A_DnD5e
Short for : Jules and Ben's Animated Assets for DnD 5e !

## Its purpose
To regroup all of our assets in one folder that is easy to update for the users. That's about it.

Unless something changes or we decide to learn more about javascript, html, etc ... we don't plan to expand it's functionalities yet.

## Its content
Our current goal is to create animations for a specific type of spell available in the SRD and PHB of the DnD5e system. These spells have to have an area of effect that stays on the battleground for a duration of **at least** one round.

- All of our assets will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format. 
- Our standard is 5 feet = 100px, for example the [Entangle spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) has a 20-foot square area of effect, so the animation will be a 400px square. With a few exceptions as follow :

  - Spells that can be represented as **a token** will be a 200px square.
  - Spells with **a huge area** like [Call lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) or [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-weather) will obviously not fit in our standard and will be dealt with differently.
  
- Our assets can be found in your Foundry data directory : \\Data\modules\JB2A_DnD5e\Library
