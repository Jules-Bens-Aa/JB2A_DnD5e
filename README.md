#### Short for : Jules&Ben's Animated Assets for DnD 5e !

# Announcements Section.

#### Warning ! If you to update our module from the version 0.0.8.3 or lower, be advised. For the version 0.0.9 and 0.0.9.1 we have completely remorked our naming convention.<br>
It will break all the paths you already set for assets from the previous versions !<br> 
Update your module **ONLY** if you know you'll have time to fix the paths before your next sessions.<br>
We sincerely apologize. We realise how much of a pain it is. Now that our naming convention is robust, it won't happen anytime soon, hopefully. Thank you for your understanding !!<br>

## Our Goal and about the module

#### Our Goal
Our current goal is to create animation **templates** for spells/abilities available in the **SRD of the DnD5e system** . The idea behind it is to offer to DnD5e users a library of assets with animations for all SRD spells/abilities for free.<br>
Keep in mind, even if our goal is to create SRD spells/abilities, we won't limit ourselves to it. Our module will have PHB spells as well.<br>
<br>
Since the launch of our Patreon, last november, our goal has already evolved. Due to a high demand from the Foundry VTT community, we will also provide compendiums of actors and macros to allow our users to setup/run their sessions more efficiently.<br>
 
#### About the module
Its primary purpose was to bundle all of our free assets into one folder. Easy to maintain, easy to update. But things evolved in time and we are eager to improve the user's experience.<br>
We are artists first and foremost. Special features in our module will need more time to implement properly. Thankfully, the community has been amazing and we already have had a lot of help.<br>

If you encounter any issues, have any questions regarding our content, or suggestions, feedback, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/njHNzeEZrX)

To be able to continue and reach our goal, we created a Patreon where you can access more variations of our assets.<br>
More info [below](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e#about-our-patreon).

#### Additionnal info
**If you are using Roll20 or Astal Tabletop**, you can use all of our assets. The zip file available for download from the lastest release contains WebM files compatible with these VTTs. However, macros and compendiums won't be of any use for you unfortunately.

**If you are a Foundry user**, this module can work with **any system available**. It has DnD5e in its name only because the templates are based on the DnD5e ruleset. For the moment, only macros are limited to the DnD5e system. This limitation is due to the modules used to create the macros. We are looking for solutions to bypass these limitations.

## Its Content

You can preview all our free assets on our [Youtube channel](https://bit.ly/33Nek6D).<br>

Besides the fact that we are trying to optimize our assets as much as we can, our standard is as follow :

 - **For templates.**
   - They will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format.<br>
   - 5 feet = 100px, for example the [Entangle spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) has a 20-foot square area of effect, so the animation will be a 400px square.<br>
   
 - **For Tokens.**
   - They will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format.<br>
   - 5 feet = 200px, less than that, the asset is too pixelated.<br>
   
 - **For instantaneous spells/abilties** (a duration of 1 turn)
   - They won't be looped and will be animated at 30 FPS due to their "explosive" nature. Frames per second must be added to maintain an acceptable fluidity during the animation.<br>
   - Their resolution will vary, but we will try to keep a certain consistency and follow our 5ft=100px rule as much as we can.<br>

In some cases, we have to experiment and see how the community reacts. For example :<br>
   - An arrow attack has a 30ft, 60ft and 90ft version. To use them efficiently you will need to install a couple of modules. Sadly it can limit these assets to a smaller range of systems. More info [here](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e#in-depth-tutorial)
   - Spells with **a huge area** like [Call lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) or [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-weather) will obviously not fit in our standard and will be dealt with differently.


## How to use our content
There are various ways to do it. From the easiest to a more advanced way to use them.<br>
Clicking on cards below will redirect you to a youtube video.<br>

<a href="https://youtu.be/c4RQjFl8C18" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kataZqy.png" alt="Tile_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hi7yvUG4kk8" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kvqbaMn.png" alt="Token_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ktVyp6sJUXw" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mw583WO.png" alt="Template_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a><br>

 - **Tiles :** Our assets are made with particular spells in mind but nothing prevents you from using them as part of your scenes/battlemaps. For example, Web could be a great addition to a cavern full of spiders ! Using them as a tile would be the best way to do it.<br>
 - **Tokens :** Animated spells like Spiritual Weapon and Dancing Lights can be used on a token instead of a tile or a template. That way, you (as a DM) or your players can move them during their turn without having to switch between tools.<br>
 - **Templates :** This one is a little bit tricky. Natively, on FoundryVTT, the template file picker won't allow you to choose a webm file. Fortunatly, there are a few options at your disposal, but it requires you to install at least one additionnal module. For the template tutorial video I used one of the module listed below. If you just want to be able to use animated templates, you only have to install one of them, and you are good to go. There are no further actions required.
    - [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/)
    - [Mess](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/mess/)

#### In-depth Tutorial    
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=264xZJjPHD8" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GsAecj3.png" alt="Tile_how_to" width="350" border="5" /></a>

Because we added compendiums of premade actors and macros, we created a more in depth tutorial video. Sadly for the moment these options are **only available for the DnD5e system.**<br>
**Note :** In the video we forgot to mention that you also need to install the module [The Furnace](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/furnace/).

List of the modules you need in order to follow along the tutorial above :
 - [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/)
 - [Midi-QOL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol/)
 - [FxMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fxmaster/)
 - [The Furnace](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/furnace/)
 
Macros can be intimidating at first, we opened a channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/njHNzeEZrX) for people to exchange ideas and to troubleshoot problems you may encounter.
