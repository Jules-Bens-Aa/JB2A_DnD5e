# JB2A_DnD5e
Short for : Jules and Ben's Animated Assets for DnD 5e !

**Note for Foundry users : This module can be used with any system available. It has DnD5e in its name only because the templates are based on the DnD5e ruleset.**

Note for other VTT users : If you are using Roll20 or Astal Tabletop, you can use all of our assets. The zip file available for download from the lastest release contains WebM files compatible with these VTTs. If you encounter any problems with our assets feel free to open an issue right here.


## Its purpose
To regroup all of our assets in one folder that is easy to update for the users. That's about it.

Unless something changes or we decide to learn more about javascript, html, etc ... we don't plan to expand it's functionalities yet.

## Its content
Our current goal is to create animations for a specific type of spell available in the SRD and PHB of the DnD5e system. These spells have to have an area of effect that stays on the battleground for a duration of **at least** one round.

- All of our assets will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format. 
- Our standard is 5 feet = 100px, for example the [Entangle spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) has a 20-foot square area of effect, so the animation will be a 400px square. With a few exceptions as follow :

  - Spells that can be represented as **a token** will be a 200px square.
  - Spells with **a huge area** like [Call lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) or [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-weather) will obviously not fit in our standard and will be dealt with differently.
  
- Our assets can be found in your Foundry data directory : \\Data\modules\JB2A_DnD5e\Library

## How to use our content
**As a Template :**<br>

As I'm currently using Token Magic FX or Mess to place our assets quickly on my scenes I totally forgot to explain how to use them with templates. Sincere apologies for that !<br>

**As a Tile :**<br>

Our assets are made from spells but nothing stops you to use them as part of your scenes/battlemaps. For example, Web could be a great addition in a cavern full of spiders ! 
Using them as a tile is the best way to do it.<br>

**As a Token :**<br>

Animated spells like Spiritual Weapon and Dancing Lights can be used on a token instead of a tile or a template. That way, you (as a DM) or your players can move them during their turn without having to switch between tools.<br>
