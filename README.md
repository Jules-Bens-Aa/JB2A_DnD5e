## Our Goal and about the module

#### Our Goal
Our current goal has been to create animation **templates** for spells/abilities available in the **SRD of the DnD5e system** . The idea behind it is to offer to DnD5e users a library of assets with animations for all SRD spells/abilities for free.<br>
Keep in mind, even if our goal is still to create SRD spells/abilities, we don't limit ourselves to it. Our module will have spells from other rule books, from different RPG systems and we're making animated environmental tiles to spruce up our maps as well.<br>
<br>
Since the launch of our Patreon, last november, our goal has already evolved. Due to a high demand from the Foundry VTT community, we provide assets for instantaneous spells and visual effects to allow our users to setup/run their sessions using macros. We have a compendium for actors and macros but they're only blueprints as our javascript knowledge is very limited. Other people from our community are working on many different types of macros. You can learn more in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m)<br> 
 
#### About the module
Its primary purpose was to bundle all of our free assets into one folder. Easy to maintain, easy to update. But things evolved in time and we are eager to improve the user's experience.<br>
We are artists first and foremost. Special features in our module will need more time to implement properly. Thankfully, the community has been amazing and we already have had a lot of help.<br>

If you encounter any issues, have any questions regarding our content, you can visit our [FAQ](http://jb2a.com/templates/FAQ.html) or if you want to share a suggestion with us or have some feedback, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m)

We created a [Patreon page](https://bit.ly/3qyORaP) where you can access more variations of our assets and help us on our journey !<br>
More info [below](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e#about-our-patreon).

#### Additionnal info
**If you are using Roll20 or Astal Tabletop**, you can use all of our assets. The zip file available for download from the lastest release contains WebM files compatible with these VTTs. However, macros and compendiums won't be of any use for you unfortunately.

**If you are a Foundry user**, this module can work with **any system available**. It has DnD5e in its name only because the templates are based on the DnD5e ruleset. For the moment, only macros are limited to the DnD5e system. This limitation is due to the modules used by the macros themselves. We are looking for solutions to bypass these limitations.

## Its Content

You can preview all our free assets on our [Youtube channel](https://bit.ly/33Nek6D).<br>

We are trying our best to optimize our assets as much as we can and our standard is as follow :

 - **For templates.**
   - They will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format.<br>
   - 5 feet = 100px, for example the [Entangle spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) has a 20-foot square area of effect, so the animation will be a 400px square.<br>
   
 - **For Tokens.**
   - They will seamlessly loop, be animated at 24 FPS and encoded to the WebM format.<br>
   - 5 feet = 200px, less than that, the asset is too pixelated.<br>
   
 - **For instantaneous spells/abilities** (a duration of 1 turn)
   - They won't be looped and will be animated at 30 FPS due to their "explosive" nature. Frames per second must be added to maintain an acceptable fluidity during the animation.<br>
   - Their resolution will vary, but we will try to keep a certain consistency and follow our 5ft=100px rule as much as we can.<br>
   - **For Macro creators** : We established templates for ranged attacks that gives us the possibility to use the space around the controlled token and its target for the animation. The template could be a good way to test macros and having a good idea of its behavior. Templates are available on our [GDrive](http://bit.ly/2K641UR) (see example below).<br> 
   
<a><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vNHtavo.png" alt="RangedAttacks_Template" width="450" border="10" /></a>   

In some cases, we have to experiment and see how the community reacts. For example :<br>
   - An arrow attack has a 30ft, 60ft and 90ft version. To use them efficiently you will need to install a couple of modules. Sadly it can limit these assets to a smaller range of systems. More info [here](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e#in-depth-tutorial)
   - Spells with **a huge area** like [Call lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) or [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-weather) will obviously not fit in our standard and will be dealt with differently.

## How to use our content
There are various ways to do it. From the easiest to a more advanced way to use them.<br>
Clicking on cards below will redirect you to a youtube video.<br>

<a href="https://youtu.be/c4RQjFl8C18" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YCTrUwM.png" alt="Tile_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hi7yvUG4kk8" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JTb6nNR.png" alt="Token_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ktVyp6sJUXw" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rkJFI1j.png" alt="Template_how_to" width="275" border="10" /></a><br>

 - **Tiles :** Our assets are made with particular spells in mind but nothing prevents you from using them as part of your scenes/battlemaps. For example, the spell Web could be a great addition to a cavern full of spiders ! Using them as a tile would be the best way to do it.<br>
 - **Tokens :** Animated spells like Spiritual Weapon and Dancing Lights can be used on a token instead of a tile or a template. That way, you (as a DM) or even your players can move them during their turn without having to switch between tools.<br>
 - **Templates :** This one is a little bit tricky. Natively, on FoundryVTT, the template file picker won't allow you to choose a webm file. Fortunatly, there is a module that will let you do it. More information on this video tutorial ["In depth tutorial"](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e#in-depth-tutorial)<br>

#### In-depth Tutorial    
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=264xZJjPHD8" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u1Ef4FC.png" alt="Tile_how_to" width="350" border="5" /></a>

Because we added compendiums of premade actors and macros, we created a more in depth tutorial video. Sadly for the moment these options are **only available for the DnD5e system.**<br>
**Note :** Our macros are blueprints, if you want all of our instantaneous spells in a compendium, you'll need to install a free module from Otigon. The paths used in his macros are based on the patreon module so you'll have to change "jb2a_patreon" to "JB2A_DnD5e" in order for them to work as intended.

List of the modules you need in order to follow along the tutorial above :
 - [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/)
 - [Midi-QOL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol/)
 - [FxMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fxmaster/)
 
 
Macros can be intimidating at first, we opened a channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gmd8MAPX4m) for people to exchange ideas and to troubleshoot problems that you may encounter.
