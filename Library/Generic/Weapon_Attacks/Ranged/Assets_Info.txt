For all the assets 

Consider the starting point at 0px for the lenght and half the width.
So for example, Throwing_Dagger_15ft_600x300 the dagger starts at 0x150px.

The point of impact is on the opposite side so Max lenght and half the width.
For example, Throwing_Dagger_15ft_600x300 the dagger strikes at 600x150px.
